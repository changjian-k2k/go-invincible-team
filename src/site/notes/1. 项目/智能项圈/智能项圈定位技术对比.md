# Spirent测试结果
```ad-important
- SpotOn’s fence line was **7x more accurate, and its boundary alerts are 6x more consistent**.
- SpotOn issued all three stimuli - two boundary warnings and one correction, **100% of the time**. Conversely, the competitive product’s alerts **worked consistently 16% of the time and offered only a static correction with no alerts 30% of the time**.
- **SpotOn performed to specification 96% of the time** (SpotOn's specifications state the fence line will not drift by more than 10 feet). On the occasions when SpotOn performed outside of spec, the drift was limited to 11.4 feet. Competitor drift could not be assessed as there is no drift specification available. The competitor's maximum drift was recorded at 32 feet.
- SpotOn is **11x more precise** in the presence of multipath (multipath happens when GPS signals are reflected off of buildings or trees).

# Spoton
When they performed a head-to-head test, they found SpotOn consistently demonstrated more accuracy and consistency. **More specifically, the fence was 7x times more accurate, the boundary warnings were 6x more consistent, and the tracking was 11x more precise in the presence of buildings and trees**.
## 为什么如此高精度
**SpotOn is the only GPS system to use an active, dual-feed antenna/receiver system.** This high-quality antenna/receiver combo filters out interference from Bluetooth and cellular signals like Halo’s active antenna but, in addition, differentiates direct and reflected GPS signals to filter out inferior signals reflecting off trees, buildings, or hills, resulting in a more accurate and reliable fence.  

This high-fidelity antenna can maintain an uninterrupted satellite connection because it has a clear view of the sky, resting on the back of the neck, the dog’s body can't block it.

SpotOn also offers T**rue Location™ technology**, which balances GPS shift, a natural phenomenon that occurs with any GPS product. SpotOn auto-corrects your dog’s location, so his boundaries and his position are more accurate.

spoton智能项圈的GPS偏移标准是3米，96%的时间能够满足要求；Halo的GPS定位最大偏移是10米。且在树丛

**An accurate fence is important to keep your dog safe**. When we designed SpotOn, we set out to make a fence that was comparable to a traditional buried wire solution. We set our standards extremely high, knowing that though all GPS products have inherent GPS drift, we could control it with high-quality components and our True Location technology. We determined the maximum acceptable drift for a GPS fence was 10 feet. We built SpotOn to meet this standard, and in the lab testing, **it performed as advertised 96% of the time**. The couple of times it drifted beyond the spec, it was only by 16 inches (maximum of 11.4 feet of drift). **Halo’s maximum drift was recorded at 32 feet**.

在有建筑物和树丛的场景下，spoton仍然能够进行有效地定位。

In a head-to-head test, **SpotOn’s tracking was 11x more accurate in the presence of buildings and trees**. This is because SpotOn Fence can access 128 satellites from four distinct constellations - *GPS, GLONASS, Beidou, and Galileo*. Connecting to 25-30 satellites at any one time, your SpotOn Fence will be in constant communication with these satellite systems, which means it can more accurately interpret your dog’s location.

# halo
关键卖点：双频GPS天线，能适配不同大小的宠物，实时位置更新
The new Halo Collar 4 is the most advanced GPS dog fence on the market, now with dual-frequency GPS we continue to set the standard for dog safety. It is also now available in a universal size for dogs big and small with a neck size range of 8”-30”.

## Final Verdict: Halo Collar is the Superior GPS Dog Fence Choice

When looking for the best GPS dog fence, Halo Collar 4 is the best option when it comes to what matters most: keeping your dog safe. Here’s why:

- Halo is significantly less expensive than SpotOn and the subscription prices are the same if you have all the features you need to keep your dog safe.
- The Halo Collar 4 fits both small and big dogs and grows with your dog, vs. SpotOn’s three distinct sizes.
- Halo is the first and only GPS dog fence to use dual-frequency GPS.
- The Halo Collar has superior technology in every way. SpotOn does not connect to Wi-Fi, has no indoor/beacon features, allows use of only one fence at a time that has to be manually designed and loaded, and Halo has much longer battery life.
- Halo’s GPS technology is more advanced with the most accurate GPS chip used in any GPS collar today, PrecisionGPS™ proprietary AI, drift prevention and assisted GPS. SpotOn lacks each of these.
- Real-time tracking with Halo actually means “real-time” with position updates on your phone every second so you always have complete peace of mind knowing that your pup’s location is always accurate. SpotOn does not have this.
- Halo uses patented technology paired with a training methodology that is both unique and more effective in getting your dog to understand what to do, using only positive reinforcement, which – at the end of the day – is the most important part of a GPS dog fence.
- Halo provides a world-class customer support team available every day that you can speak with live via in-app or web-based Zoom video calling.

### Dual-Frequency GPS
[Halo Collar 4](https://www.halocollar.com/halo-collar-4/) is the first and only GPS dog fence that combines data from L1 and L5 GPS bands for the most accurate positioning. SpotOn uses the L1 band alone which is often impacted by tall buildings, foliage, tunnels, and water. Using both bands improves the reception from all satellites in more difficult locations, meaning accuracy isn’t as impacted by these obstacles.
### Most accurate GPS receiver
Our GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver is the most accurate chip used in any GPS collar, pinpointing your pup’s location with an incredible average precision of just 1.4 feet*. That means wherever they roam, you know exactly where they are and fences are enforced consistently and quickly. SpotOn’s receiver chip is 33% less accurate. *Independently verified*.
### PrecisionGPS™
Our proprietary AI software cuts through the noise, focusing only on direct GPS signals to give you the most accurate location data possible. SpotOn does not include this functionality.
### More satellite systems
We’re tuned in to six different satellite constellations, four of which are global, with 151 satellites at our disposal, keeping your pup safe no matter where they wander. SpotOn does receive signals from the same four global constellations, but not from the two regional ones.
### Drift prevention
We use smart sensors and AI to catch and eliminate position drift when your dog is not moving. SpotOn has a more basic motion-detection method that is easily fooled, for example, when your dog turns its head.
### Active antenna
Both collars have an active GPS antenna to ensure the best reception, even in areas with poor coverage or obstacles like clouds and trees. However, Halo’s active antenna is the only one that supports L1 and L5 reception.
### 4 GPS updates per second
With four updates every second, you get real-time fence detection for your pup. Also, when your dog is running, they will still get instant feedback as they approach boundaries, not 20-feet after they’ve crossed them, like with SpotOn.
